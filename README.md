This repository demonstrates a common SQL error where a query returns an unexpected empty result set due to implicit type conversion issues. The `bug.sql` file contains the problematic SQL query that attempts to compare a string-based salary column to a numeric value. The `bugSolution.sql` shows how to fix this error by explicitly converting the string-based salary column to a numeric type before the comparison, ensuring the query returns the correct results.
